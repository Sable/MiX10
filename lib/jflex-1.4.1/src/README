This directory contains the source code for JFlex.

For your convenience, the following generated lexer and parser files
are included in the distribution:

JFlex/LexScan.java  (lexer, generated from src/LexScan.flex)
JFlex/LexParse.java (parser, generated from src/LexParse.cup)
JFlex/sym.java      (parser symbols, generated from src/LexParse.cup)


Dependencies:
If you just want to compile the JFlex sources, no further tools are
necessary.  If you want to compile the ant task, you need the ant
classes in you class path, if you want to compile the unit tests, you
need the junit classes in yor class path.

To build everything from scratch:
In class path:
junit.jar    >= 3.8.1     [http://www.junit.org/]
ant.jar      >= 1.4       [optional, http://ant.apache.org/]
In ant lib dir:
java_cup.jar >= 0.10l     [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/~appel/modern/java/CUP/]
JFlex.jar    >= 1.4pre1   [http://www.jflex.de/]


Dir contents:
build.xml:
  for use with the ant build tool [http://ant.apache.org/]
  
  Useful targets are:
  jar:   recompiles all JFlex classes, generates lexer+parser 
         only if necessary, zips up all compiled classes in
         ../lib/JFlex.jar

  build: cleans up everything and does a completely new build

  realclean: deletes generated, temporary and *.class files
 
manifest:
  jar manifest file for JFlex.jar

skeleton:
  a skeleton file matching exactly the precompiled scanner skeleton.
  Can be used together with the --skel option 

skeleton.nested:
  a skeleton file that supports nested input streams (see the manual 
  for the API). Can be used together with the --skel option

JFlex/anttask
  source files of the JFlex Ant task (contributed by Rafal Mantiuk)
