function drv_foo()
% This example shows how the constant variable is defined
% and how the value is propagated
% 'n' is not constant-variable, 'm' is a constant variable.
% however, 'r' is with value 'r', and 't' is as well and has value 2*4*r
 n=3;
 m=2*4;
 r = n*2;
 t = m*r;	  
 while(n<10)
	n=(2+t);
